                          <BR>b. Obtain permits and consult local authorities before starting planting activities.
                          <BR>c. Collect mangrove seeds from a trusted source or contact local conservation organizations to get suitable seeds.</p>
                     <P>Seed preparation:</P>
                        <p>a. Check mangrove seedlings to ensure they are healthy and compatible with species suitable for the local environment.
                       <br>  b. Soak the seedling roots in clean water for a few hours to increase the humidity and facilitate planting.</p>
                      <p>Planting:</p>
                        <P>a. Make a planting hole of sufficient size to accommodate the roots of the mangrove seedlings.
                            <br>  b. Place the seedling carefully in the hole, making sure the roots are at the right depth.
                             <br> c. Fill the hole with soil, make sure the seeds are firmly attached and don't shake easily.
                             <br> d. Pile a little soil around the base of the seedling to provide additional support.
                             <br> e. Repeat these steps for each seedling to be planted, keeping sufficient distance between seedlings to allow for optimal growth.</P>
