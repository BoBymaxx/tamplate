                            <h2><b>Impact of Destruction of mangrove forests</b></h2>
                            <P>The destruction of mangrove forests has a significant impact on the environment and local communities. The following are some of the impacts that can occur due to damage to mangrove forests:

                                Coastal Erosion and Abrasion: Mangrove forests serve as a natural barrier against coastal abrasion and erosion. When mangrove forests are damaged or lost, coastal areas become vulnerable to damage by sea waves and water currents. This can lead to shoreline subsidence, loss of land, and damage to infrastructure and settlements.</P>
                                <P>Floods and Tsunamis: Mangroves also play a role in absorbing water and stabilizing water levels in coastal areas. When a mangrove forest is damaged, its ability to absorb water decreases, which can increase the risk of flooding in the surrounding area. In addition, healthy mangrove forests can also dampen and reduce the energy of tsunami waves, providing protection to people on the mainland.</P>
                                    <P>Loss of Biodiversity: Mangrove forests are an important habitat for many species of animals and plants, including rare and endangered species. When mangrove forests are damaged or lost, the high biodiversity in them is threatened with extinction. It can also disrupt the food chain and the balance of the surrounding marine ecosystem.

                                        Deterioration of Water Quality: Mangroves have the ability to filter water and retain sediment that carries excess pollutants and nutrients. When mangrove forests are damaged, the flow of water from land to sea is no longer filtered effectively. This can result in increased water pollution, including increased levels of nutrients and sedimentation in the surrounding waters.</P>

							<BR><P>Loss of Natural Resources: Mangrove forests provide a variety of valuable natural resources for local communities, such as fish, shrimp, shellfish, firewood, and building materials. The destruction of mangrove forests results in a loss of this resource, which can negatively impact the livelihoods, economic sustainability and daily lives of people who depend on mangroves.

								Climate Change: Mangroves have a significant capacity to sequester and store carbon. When mangrove forests are damaged or degraded, the carbon stored in them is released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global climate change.
								
								Therefore, it is important to protect and preserve mangrove forests in order to minimize the negative impacts that arise. Conservation, rehabilitation and sustainable management efforts are needed to restore and maintain this important mangrove ecosystem.</P>

								<h2><b>positive and negative impacts</b></h2>
								<p>Positive impacts of mangroves and their surroundings:</p>
								<P>Coastal protection: Mangroves serve as natural fortifications that protect the coastline from erosion and marine storms. Strong mangrove roots help dampen tidal waves, reduce the impact of beach abrasion, and maintain shoreline stability.

									<P>Biodiversity: Mangroves are home to a wide variety of distinctive species of plants, animals and microorganisms. They provide an important habitat for fish, molluscs, crustaceans, birds, reptiles, mammals and insects. The existence of mangroves helps maintain local biodiversity and protect endangered species.</P>
									<P>Negative impacts of mangroves and their surroundings:</P>
									<P>Habitat reduction: Land encroachment, infrastructure development, mining, and natural resource exploitation can result in loss of mangrove habitat. Reducing the area of ​​mangrove forests can cause loss of biodiversity and affect species that depend on mangrove ecosystems.</P>

										<P>Pollution: Human activities such as industrial, agricultural and residential waste that are not managed properly can contaminate mangrove ecosystems and reduce water quality.</P>
										<h2><b>prevent sea water pollution through mangrove forests</b></h2>
										<P>Mangroves can play a role in preventing seawater pollution in several ways, as follows:</P>
										<P>Water Filtration: Mangrove roots act as a natural filter. They retain sediment, nutrients, and chemicals from water flowing through the root system. This helps reduce levels of pollution in the water before it reaches the sea.</P>
										<p>Waste Storage: Mangroves have the ability to absorb and remove several pollutants and waste from water. Plants and microorganisms that live in the mangrove root system can assist in the process of biodegradation and detoxification of waste.</p>

											<P>Reduction of Soil Erosion: The complex root system of mangroves helps to stabilize the surrounding soil. They reduce soil erosion by retaining sediment and binding soil particles. This reduces the flow of sewage and sediment into ocean waters, which can cause pollution.</p>
